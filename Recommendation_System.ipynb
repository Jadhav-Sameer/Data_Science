    "The cosine similarity–based recommendation system effectively identifies anime with similar characteristics. It is suitable for content-based recommendation, especially when user interaction data is limited. However, personalization can be improved by integrating collaborative filtering techniques."

    "**User-Based Collaborative Filtering:**\n",
    "User-based collaborative filtering identifies users with similar behavior or preferences and recommends items that similar users have liked but the target user has not yet interacted with.\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages:\n",
    "Intuitive and easy to understand.\n",
    "Captures community-based trends.\n",
    "\n",
    "Limitations:\n",
    "Poor scalability with large user bases.\n",
    "Sensitive to changes in user behavior.\n",
    "Suffers from data sparsity when users have few interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Item-Based Collaborative Filtering:**\n",
    "Item-based collaborative filtering focuses on similarity between items, recommending items that are similar to those a user has already liked.\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages:\n",
    "More scalable and stable than user-based methods.\n",
    "Item similarities change less frequently.\n",
    "Performs well in large-scale systems (e-commerce platforms).\n",
    "\n",
    "Limitations:\n",
    "Limited personalization for users with very unique tastes.\n",
    "Cold-start problem for new items.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2.What is collaborative filtering, and how does it work?**\n",
    "->\n",
    "Collaborative filtering is a recommendation system technique that predicts user preferences by finding patterns in the behavior of similar users, working on the idea that \"people who agreed in the past will agree in the future\" to suggest items (movies, products) a user might like based on what their \"neighbors\" (similar users) enjoyed. It works by building a user-item matrix of interactions (ratings, views), identifying user/item similarities (e.g., via cosine similarity), and then recommending items liked by similar users but not yet seen by the target user. \n",
    "\n",
    "Working:\n",
    "1. Data Collection\n",
    "The system gathers user preferences via two types of feedback: \n",
    "Explicit Feedback: Direct input from users, such as star ratings (1–5) or likes.\n",
    "Implicit Feedback: Inferred preferences from user actions, such as browsing history, purchase records, or time spent viewing an item.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Similarity Computation\n",
    "To identify patterns, the system calculates \"distance\" or similarity between users or items using mathematical metrics: \n",
    "Cosine Similarity: Measures the angle between two vectors to determine how closely they align.\n",
    "Pearson Correlation: Measures the linear correlation between users' ratings, often adjusting for individual rating biases (e.g., \"tough raters\"). \n",
    "User-Based: Recommends items that users in the target user's neighborhood liked, but the target user hasn't interacted with.\n",
    "Item-Based: Recommends items similar to those the user has already liked.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Preference Prediction\n",
    "Identify nearest neighbors (similar users or similar items).\n",
    "Aggregate their preferences (weighted average of ratings).\n",
    "Predict the missing value.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Recommendation Generation\n",
    "Items with the highest predicted scores are recommended to the user."
